Project Overview

This project demonstrates end-to-end SQL data cleaning, transformation, and normalization using a real-world survey dataset. 
The raw data was imported from Excel into SQL Server and systematically cleaned to improve data integrity, analytical usability, and relational structure.
The goal of this project was to simulate production-level data preparation practices used by data analysts, DBAs, and data engineers.
